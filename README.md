# IRIS

Iris is a service discovery and load balancing library built on top of 
ZMQ. It uses the Majordomo Pattern to build a basic DEALER-ROUTER-DEALER
 pattern. 
 
It does not adhere to the exact protocol specified in the zmq specifications 
for message exchange. 

Basic examples are available in the `examples` directory.


## TODO

1. Heartbeat checks
2. Service Listings
3. Realtime monitoring
4. Logging of events.
